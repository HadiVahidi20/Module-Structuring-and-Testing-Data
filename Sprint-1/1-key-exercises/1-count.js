let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing



//line 3 is updating the value of count by adding 1 to its current value, so count now equals 1 and every time we run the code it will increment by 1.
